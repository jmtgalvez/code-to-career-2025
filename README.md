# Project Installation Guide

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository (Optional)
If you haven't already cloned the project, use the following command:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Client Dependencies
Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:
```sh
cd client
npm install
```

### 3. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
```sh
cd ../backend
npm install
```

## Running the Project
### Start the Client
```sh
cd client
npm start
```

### Start the Backend
```sh
cd ../backend
npm start
```

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to configure environment variables if required (e.g., `.env` files in the backend and client directories).
- If using a database, ensure it is running before starting the backend.
- If using a monorepo setup, consider using tools like `npm workspaces` or `yarn workspaces` for better dependency management.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, try the following:
- Run `npm cache clean --force` and reinstall dependencies.
- Ensure you are using a compatible Node.js version.
- Check logs for error messages and consult documentation accordingly.

For further assistance, refer to the project's documentation or contact the maintainers.
